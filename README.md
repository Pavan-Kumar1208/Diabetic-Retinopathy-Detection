# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a serious eye disease caused by diabetes. It is a major threat
to vision health globally, and current diagnostic methods are time-consuming and
inaccessible. This project proposes a web application to revolutionize DR detection. This
web application uses deep learning to analyze retinal images and classify them into
different stages of DR progression.
